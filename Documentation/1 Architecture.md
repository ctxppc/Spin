# Architecture of the Spin Framework
*This document contains architecture design guidelines and may not reflect the current state of the framework.*

Spin defines 3 domain-specific languages (DSLs), with each one building on the previous, using Conifer as a DSL modelling framework:
1. **SpinXML**
2. **SpinHTML**
3. **Spin**
